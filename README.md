# inferredArt [under constrcuction]
Make art with your own hands based on the execution of your code, don't get code to make art.


Instead of getting machines to mimic creativity, use your creativity to depcit what the machine is doing!
InferredArt (IA) uses the hex dump of your executable to provide a list of colours and shapes to use as a guide for your art.
